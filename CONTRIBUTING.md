Steps to contribute

    Comment on the issue you want to work on. Make sure it's not assigned to someone else.

    If you think an algorithm or a solution code of Leetcode and GeekforGeeks is missing, create an issue.

Making a PR

        Make sure you have been assigned the issue to which you are making a PR.
        If you make PR before being assigned, It will be labeled invalid and closed without merging.

    Fork the repo and clone it on your machine.
    Add a upstream link to main branch in your cloned repo

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Py-Contributors/AlgorithmsAndDataStructure.git

    Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

    git pull upstream master

    Create your feature branch

    git checkout -b <feature-name>

    Commit all the changes

    git commit -am "Meaningful commit message"

    Push the changes for review

    git push origin <branch-name>

    Create a PR from our repo on Github.

Additional Notes

    Code should be properly commented to ensure it's readability.
    If you've added code that should be tested, add tests as comments.
    Make sure your code properly formatted.
    Issue that pull request!

Issue suggestions/Bug reporting

When you are creating an issue, make sure it's not already present. Furthermore, provide a proper description of the changes. If you are suggesting any code improvements, provide through details about the improvements.

Great Issue suggestions tend to have:

    A quick summary of the changes.
    In case of any bug provide steps to reproduce
        Be specific!
        Give sample code if you can.
        What you expected would happen
        What actually happens
        Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
        
 Thats all folks. Happy Contributing! Thank you.
